# design

This is a showcase of my previous Desing work for UNF undergraduate as an advertising major and the internships I completed while atending university. Both #igniteMediaJax and CATA: Consumers against Toxic Apparel. 

I have also included an AppRiver folder to display some of the social media posts and online marketing creatives I did.
