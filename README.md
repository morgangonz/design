# Design

This is a showcase of my previous design work for UNF undergraduate as an advertising major and the two internships I completed while atending university, #igniteMediaJax and CATA: Consumers against Toxic Apparel. 

I have also included an AppRiver folder to display some of the social media posts and online marketing creatives I did.
